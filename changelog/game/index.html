		_________________________ <br>
		SAY HELLO TO SMARTER!<br>
		<br>
		Welcome to EJ Multigames V3.7.0 in this update i have added a lot of behind sense improvements, and also a hole bunch of fail safe features like fists! so if you run out of swords your not stuck, if you don't have enough gold to buy another sword. also added a brand new level system thats more modern\ complex but not complex!<br>
		as well as that their is a smarter newer reload system, made possible by my ingenious mind... (cough) and the advanced power of multitasking using threading!...<br>
		<br>
		I also have notices that the battles are to easy, so their will be minor changes to all swords, and the hole economy.<br>
		<br>
		If you are having a look around through the files and notice a few extra ones that do nothing... yet... ;-) shh<br>
        That will be for update V3.8.0. so don't touch.<br>

        NEWS:\__________________<br>
        Due to EJ Multigames being more of a add on now, i have decided to discontinue it... im sorry.<br>
        <br>
        I have decided to give it one last make over. And if bugs are found i will fix them depending on the severity of the bug, otherwise it will not be included in the main updates.<br>
        <br>
        But on a good note, EJ Multigames medieval events will now be the complete game! this means...<br>
        Less work for me (yes!)...<br>
        Better updates for you!<br>
        <br>
        EJ Multigames medieval events will now be taking over the V3.7.0, mainly because their would be a lot of problems if it didn't, but also because it kind of deserves it!<br>
        <br>

		Their has been some minor improvements to the way things display to make what you read more clearer! When being sent back to a game its way more clearer, instead of "you will be sent back to the game menu", Its now "you will be returned to (game your in) menu"

		<br><br>

		GAME IMPROVMENTS:<br>
		<br>
		-	improved the in game interface for the random number game.<br>
		<br>
		-	improved the text in number knowledge, All modes!.<br>
		<br>
		-	improved unnecessary imports, in all areas. making code more neat and
			reducing time taken to execute the code.<br>
		<br>
		-	improved the info option on all games, the program now tells you that
			its searching, when its opening it, and or if it failed.<br>
		<br>
		BUGS:<br>
		<br>

	<h1 id="h6">V1.4.0</h1>
	<hr>
	<p id="p07">
		Say welcome to the new game... Number knowledge!<br><br>
		NOTES:<br><br>
		In this update i have cleaned up behind the scenes code, this should make it easier for beginner coders to read and be inspired by my code.<br>
		I have also added a brand new game! Number knowledge. You should see this update containing this game in a couple of weeks. As well as minor bug fixes and improvements to the game.<br><br>
		IDEAS:<br><br>
		Here is a little idea! try finding in the game code something that looks like this.<br><br>
		os.startfile('--')<br><br>
		in-between the (' ') you can past a song link! to do so right click on your selected song and select copy, then paste in the song! ('past here')<br><br>
		I also added a key in the game so if you go through the code you can work out what's what quicker, and what each role the code plays.<br><br>
		IMPROVMENTS:<br><br>
		-improved spelling/ questions and answering.<br>
		-Cleaned up some code/ behind scenes.<br>
		-Made the change name option more neat.<br>
		-Made the disclaimer show before the game starts, their for improving the main menu look.<br><br>
		medieval events improvements:<br><br>
		-	fixed previous code where some values where incorrect.<br>
		-	added some new code that can kick you if you don't have enough health in an events event.
		 	e.g. when you don't win against the daemon you get asked if you want to repair,
			now if your health is lower then 1 you don't receive the ability to repair.<br><br>
		BUGS:<br><br>
		1.	Fixed trivia game scoring bug again. Re-engineered it to be fail safe. And give accurate scores rather then just (one to two questions where right) answers.<br>
		2.	Spelling fixes and improvements.<br>
		3.      fixed some OS errors and input errors broken in update 1.2.0 and 1.3.0

		BUG FIXED WHEN TYPING A NUMBER IN THE NUMBER GUSSING GAME MENU IT WOULD CRASH.<br><br>
		[SOLUTION]<br>
		NOW YOU GET NOTIFIED AND ASKED TO ENTER ANOTHER NUMBER, TURNED OUT BETTER THEN EXPECTED!  [FIXED IN EASY AND HARD MODE] BUG FOUND BY USER.<br><br>
		[COUSE OF BUG]<br>
		THE COUSE OF THE BUG WAS A MISSING (W) IN AN INPUT STATEMENT, YEAH THAT’S RIGHT IT’S PRETTY SERIOUS…<br><br><br>
		-BUG THAT’S GAVE YOU 0 POINTS IN NUMBER GAME SQUISHED!<br><br>
		[SOLUTION]<br>
		NOW YOU HAVE 11 POSSIBLE  POINTS TO GET, BUT IT WILL ONLY BE TO FIX THE BUG. YOU STILL REALLY HAVE ONLY 10 TO OBTAIN UNLESS YOU GET IT IN THE FIRST GO. [FIXED IN EASY AND HARD MODE]<br><br>
		[COUSE OF BUG]<br>
		THE COUSE WAS THAT 10 POINTS WASN’T ENOUGH NOW ITS 11!<br><br><br>
		-FIXED BUG THAT KICKED YOU OUT IF AN INCORRECT INPUT WAS ENTERED IN	MAIN MENU.<br><br>
		[SOLUTION]<br>
		I ADDED AN ERROR WHICH POPS UP IF AN INCORRECT INPUT IS ENTERED.<br><br>
		[COUSE OF BUG]<br>
		THE COUSE OF THIS BUG WAS THAT’S IF YOU ENTERED AN INCORRECT INPUT (AN INPUT THAT HAD NO USE) IT WOULD READ IT AS NOTHING, SO ADDING AN ERROR FIXED THAT AND SENT THE 	GAME STRAIT BACK TO THE MAIN MENU AS WELL AS TELLING YOU THAT YOU ENTERED AN INCORRECT INPUT!<br><br><br>
		NOW GO…  ENJOY!
