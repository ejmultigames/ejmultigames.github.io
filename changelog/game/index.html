	<p id="04">
		MAJOR BEHIND THE SCENSE IMPROVMENT AND BUG FIX UPDATE.<br><br>
		NOTES:<br><br>
		The behind scenes improvements should help the game open much quicker and execute things in a more speedier time frame as well as only doing things specific to that game, ensuring that the game doesn’t read any other games by accident making bugs almost impossible for all the games. As well as all that the games should be less invasive for low grade computers. Also updated game instructions for the this update.<br><br>
		IMPROVMENTS:<br><br>
		-Added speed improvements to the overall game read (notes) to learn more.<br><br>
		-Added the naming system! It has finally been fully built into the game! Through lots of failed attempts it is finally here! As well as being able to change it in the game!<br><br>
		Added an date, time feature, every time you return to main menu the time gets updated.<br><br>
		Added error numbering so you can self-diagnose errors! Document will be coming soon.<br><br>
		BUGS:<br><br>
		1.	Spelling fixes}<br>
		2.	In game/ incorrect information fixed}<br>
		3.	Bug that when pressing n to get out of (number game)easy) the game would ask again for yes or no}<br>

	<h1 id="h5">v1.4.0</h1>
	<hr>
	<p id="p05">
		Say welcome to the new game... Number knowledge!<br><br>
		NOTES:<br><br>
		In this update i have cleaned up behind the scenes code, this should make it easier for beginner coders to read and be inspired by my code.<br>
		I have also added a brand new game! Number knowledge. You should see this update containing this game in a couple of weeks. As well as minor bug fixes and improvements to the game.<br><br>
		IDEAS:<br><br>
		Here is a little idea! try finding in the game code something that looks like this.<br><br>
		os.startfile('--')<br><br>
		in-between the (' ') you can past a song link! to do so right click on your selected song and select copy, then paste in the song! ('past here')<br><br>
		I also added a key in the game so if you go through the code you can work out what's what quicker, and what each role the code plays.<br><br>
		IMPROVMENTS:<br><br>
		-improved spelling/ questions and answering.<br>
		-Cleaned up some code/ behind scenes.<br>
		-Made the change name option more neat.<br>
		-Made the disclaimer show before the game starts, their for improving the main menu look.<br><br>
		medieval events improvements:<br><br>
		-	fixed previous code where some values where incorrect.<br>
		-	added some new code that can kick you if you don't have enough health in an events event.
		 	e.g. when you don't win against the daemon you get asked if you want to repair,
			now if your health is lower then 1 you don't receive the ability to repair.<br><br>
		BUGS:<br><br>
		1.	Fixed trivia game scoring bug again. Re-engineered it to be fail safe. And give accurate scores rather then just (one to two questions where right) answers.<br>
		2.	Spelling fixes and improvements.<br>
		3.      fixed some OS errors and input errors broken in update 1.2.0 and 1.3.0
