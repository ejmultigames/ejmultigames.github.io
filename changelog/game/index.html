MAJOR UPDATE... THAT’S NOT A LIE.<br>
<br>
IMPROVMENTS:<br>
<br>
-IMPROVMENTS TO THE MEDIEVAL EVENTS GAME, YOU CAN NOW QUIT AT ANY TIME, TO THE GAME MENU JUST BY PRESSING Q OR TYPING QUIT.<br>
-WHEN USING THE INFO OPTION IN THE NUMBER GAME, YOU ARE NOW AUTOMATICLY TAKEN BACK TO THE GAME MENU INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PRESS B.<br>
-NO MATTER WHAT THE GAME CAN NO LONGER BE BROKEN WITH AN NCORRECT INPUT! ITS INCORRECT INPUT FREE…<br>
<br>
BUGS:
<br>
BUG FIXED WHEN TYPING A NUMBER IN THE NUMBER GUSSING GAME MENU IT WOULD CRASH.
<br>
<br>
[SOLUTION]<br>
NOW YOU GET NOTIFIED AND ASKED TO ENTER ANOTHER NUMBER, TURNED OUT BETTER THEN EXPECTED!  [FIXED IN EASY AND HARD MODE] BUG FOUND BY USER.
<br>
<br>
[COUSE OF BUG]<br>
THE COUSE OF THE BUG WAS A MISSING (W) IN AN INPUT STATEMENT, YEAH THAT’S RIGHT IT’S PRETTY SERIOUS…
<br>
<br>
<br>
-BUG THAT’S GAVE YOU 0 POINTS IN NUMBER GAME SQUISHED!
<br>
<br>
[SOLUTION]<br>
NOW YOU HAVE 11 POSSIBLE  POINTS TO GET, BUT IT WILL ONLY BE TO FIX THE BUG. YOU STILL REALLY HAVE ONLY 10 TO OBTAIN UNLESS YOU GET IT IN THE FIRST GO. [FIXED IN EASY AND HARD MODE]
<br>
<br>
[COUSE OF BUG]<br>
THE COUSE WAS THAT 10 POINTS WASN’T ENOUGH NOW ITS 11!
<br>
<br>
<br>
-FIXED BUG THAT KICKED YOU OUT IF AN INCORRECT INPUT WAS ENTERED IN	MAIN MENU.
<br>
<br>
[SOLUTION]<br>
I ADDED AN ERROR WHICH POPS UP IF AN INCORRECT INPUT IS ENTERED.
<br>
<br>
[COUSE OF BUG]<br>
THE COUSE OF THIS BUG WAS THAT’S IF YOU ENTERED AN INCORRECT INPUT (AN INPUT THAT HAD NO USE) IT WOULD READ IT AS NOTHING, SO ADDING AN ERROR FIXED THAT AND SENT THE GAME STRAIT BACK TO THE MAIN MENU AS WELL AS TELLING YOU THAT YOU ENTERED AN INCORRECT INPUT!
<br>
<br>
<br>
NOW GO…  ENJOY!

MAJOR BEHIND THE SCENSE IMPROVMENT AND BUG FIX UPDATE.
<br>
<br>
NOTES:
<br>
<br>
The behind scenes improvements should help the game open much quicker and execute things in a more speedier time frame as well as only doing things specific to that game, ensuring that the game doesn’t read any other games by accident making bugs almost impossible for all the games. As well as all that the games should be less invasive for low grade computers. Also updated game instructions for the this update.
<br>
<br>
IMPROVMENTS:
<br>
<br>
-Added speed improvements to the overall game read (notes) to learn more.
<br>
<br>
-Added the naming system! It has finally been fully built into the game! Through lots of failed attempts it is finally here! As well as being able to change it in the game!
<br>
<br>
Added an date, time feature, every time you return to main menu the time gets updated.
<br>
<br>
Added error numbering so you can self-diagnose errors! Document will be coming soon.
<br>
<br>
BUGS:
<br>
<br>
1.	Spelling fixes}<br>
2.	In game/ incorrect information fixed}<br>
3.	Bug that when pressing n to get out of (number game)easy) the game would ask again for yes or no}<br>
4.	Fixed an old error with the quiz game}<br>

<h5 id="h5">v1.4.0</h5>
<hr>
<p id="p05">
Say welcome to the new game... Number knowledge!
<br>
<br>
NOTES:
<br>
<br>
In this update i have cleaned up behind the scenes code, this should make it easier for beginner coders to read and be inspired by my code.<br>
I have also added a brand new game! Number knowledge. You should see this update containing this game in a couple of weeks. As well as minor bug fixes and improvements to the game.
<br>
<br>
IDEAS:
<br>
<br>
Here is a little idea! try finding in the game code something that looks like this.<br><br>

 os.startfile('--')<br><br>
 
in-between the (' ') you can past a song link! to do so right click on your selected song and select copy, then paste in the song! ('past here')<br><br>

I also added a key in the game so if you go through the code you can work out what's what quicker, and what each role the code plays.
<br>
<br>
IMPROVMENTS:
<br>
<br>
-improved spelling/ questions and answering.<br>
-Cleaned up some code/ behind scenes.<br>
-Made the change name option more neat.<br>
-Made the disclaimer show before the game starts, their for improving the main menu look.
<br>
<br>
medieval events improvements:
<br>
<br>
-	fixed previous code where some values where incorrect.<br>
-	added some new code that can kick you if you don't have enough health in an events event.
 	e.g. when you don't win against the daemon you get asked if you want to repair,
	now if your health is lower then 1 you don't receive the ability to repair.
<br>
<br>
BUGS:
<br>
<br>
1.	Fixed trivia game scoring bug again. Re-engineered it to be fail safe. And give accurate scores rather then just (one to two questions where right) answers.<br>
2.	Spelling fixes and improvements.<br>
3.      fixed some OS errors and input errors broken in update 1.2.0 and 1.3.0
