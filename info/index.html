			this website provides a variety of game downloads. the game files will allow "you" to modify any game code and or use it in other programs for learning purposes. And or personal use for "Free". When downloading content you are responsible for what you do with the code. I am not in any way involved with viruses or mail-wear.

			The game (EJ Multigames by EJ Studios) was made using python 3.7.4. and is provided as is, I own all rights to the game and all documents for it. Though the game is open for new users to learn or use the code. I will be more then happy for new to python users to copy code for personal use. recognition would be extremely appreciated, And a mention of this website would be loved in return.
