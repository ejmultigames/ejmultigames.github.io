<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p id="p01">Here you will learn about me and what i love to create. As well as tips tricks, And where to find stuff</p>

<hr>

<P id="p02">Firstly my name is Ethan the creator of EJ multigames, I take pride in coding and love the experience i get from it, I am still currently working on text based games but cant wait to start creating free to play GUI (Graphical User Interface) games! I love learning new things and implementing them into my games and seeing them come to life! I will say that writing down notes is a very good way to remember things, I have had countless times where i wanted to do something but forgot...<br>
I really like games like, clash of clans. And hope that one day i can build such a game, As well as being new to coding in python i am also new in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, This website was built using these three coding languages to work in unison to give you what you are looking at now! Yes things might be a little bit off but please ensure as i get better at HTML it will improve and also become much cleaner looking.

<br>

<br>

Some might ask why do you put all of your versions up for download?<br>
well thats an easy answer! I love progress! I love seeing things how they where, And then how they have been improved!
</p>

<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p id="p03">
	Threw out the last few months of coding i have figured out a bit of helpful tips and tricks you can try with coding!
	<br>
	One of these tricks is that its ok to cheat! If you find something that works, Or looks good in any coding language keep it! And reuse it don't bother doing something the "right" way if you already got something working...
	<br>
	<br>
	Here is a tip! W3schools is an awesome place to learn code! in fact pretty much everything you see now is a product of W3schools, You should totally check it out if you are trying to do code for the first time! Its a great safe learning place thats totally free!
