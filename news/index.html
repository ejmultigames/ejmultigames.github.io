<li>Expect some error reports soon! This is so you can determine what happened when an error pops up, In the program it will have something that looks like this, Error 1 reason here. If you want to know more on how to fix the error you can look at the error report! -This will be located in the second menu of downloads, Or you can search for it in the main menu.
<br>
<br>
<li>The game has received a name change as well since the old name wasn't suited for the changes it goes through, e.g. having three games but it being called 2 games in 1. And as for update 1.4.0 that will be released very soon! So hold in their.
<br>
<br>
<li>Hopefully where will be a suggestions page that contains all of your suggestions, Feedback and code examples!
<br>
<br>
<li>I will also hopefully make an code example page for beginner coders! I love coding an i want people to know how its done! Once you know it theirs no stopping you. It will contain code from my games and maybe even not from my game, I might be learning as well so if you see something wrong don't hesitate to say something!
<br>
<br>
<li>In update 1.4.0 i will add an update checker, so as soon as you start the game it checks straight away for an update!
